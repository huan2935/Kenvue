#### How are you going to approach the problem(abstract)?
All of us should look through and try to understand the data provided. Then, we should clean the data and draft some graphs to understand the data better. We should investigate different external data to see if it provides us with more information. Using the trends we have graphed and the external information we have gathered we should start to guess the need states and select 3 to explore further. 

#### What do you hope to achieve, given the data?
Given the data, we hope to correctly guess the need states, forecast figures and draw interesting insights. 

#### Who is in your group, and what is the division of labour?
